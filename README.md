# Blind-Assistance-System
This is a vision enhancer-based module specifically for the BLIND VICTIMS. The system is designed so that the blind person can take the help of AN APPLICATION, which in turn sends Real-Time Frames to the LAPTOP-BASED WIRELESS NETWORKED SYSTEM. It works on REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION using Tensor Flow APIs. It has a core feature of approximate distance calculation and VoiceBased wireless feedback generation w.r.t the DISTANCE CALCULATION. Integrated Machine Learning System which allows the Blind Victims to identify and classify RealTime Based Common Day-to-day Objects and generate voice feedback and calculates distance which produces warnings whether he/she is very close or far away from the object. The same system can be used in Obstacle Detection.
